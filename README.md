# JavascriptCommentManager
A comment manager system made with javascript.<br>
The entire project was made before I learn git & github reason why there's no major commit. <br>

Please notice that the project was created by a 14 years old teenager learning javascript.<br>
<br>
SO, I will recommend you to not professionally use this project!<br>
<br>
I didn't updated this for a great use and it's not completly what I expected.
<br>
notice that npm feature were added after projects' developpement(not when coding the project).<br>
I learned npm after making this project. <br>
<br>
Then I will notice that the app.js file is a minified and bundled file. You can find the "official" app.js in the Javascript folder.<br>
You can also view modules that i built for the app in the my_modules folder.<br>
